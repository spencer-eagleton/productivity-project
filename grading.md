# Dooey Grading Notes

## General Notes
* This turned out really great -- I love the styling and the app works well!
* Code looks really clean and is easy to read / understand
* It would be nice to allow users to pick their own work / break time and wouldn't be too difficult to implement
    * Add user inputs for those values and store them on the user object
    * On timer.js grab the data and use it instead of your hard coded times
